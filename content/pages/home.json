Sebastian Schwindt completed his Bachelor (2010) and Master (2012) studies at the Technical University of Munich (Germany) in Environmental Engineering.\n\nAfter a short detour into the private sector, Sebastian Schwindt completed his doctorate at the Ecole Polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland) from 2013 to 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Anton J. Schleiss and Prof. Mário Franca. The title of his PhD thesis is *Hydro-morphological processes through permeable sediment traps at mountain rivers* with a focus on morphodynamic processes in mountain rivers. The thesis can be downloaded at [EPFL's website](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/231182).\n\nBetween 2017 and December 2019, Sebastian Schwindt pursued postdoctoral research at the University of California, Davis (USA) with Prof. Greg Pasternack. The emphasis of his postdoctoral research was on the ecohydraulic enhancement of California's Yuba River. Sebastian Schwindt made a fundamental contribution to restoration science with an algorithmic approach to the estimation of lifespans of river engineering features. The outcome is the software River Architect, which is freely available and thoroughly documented on [riverarchitect.github.io](https://riverarchitect.github.io/).\n\nMore information about Sebastian Schwindt and his scientific career can be found on [ORCID.org](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7206-0542)."
